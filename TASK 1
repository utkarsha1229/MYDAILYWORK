TASK 1:- Create a program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess it. Provide feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low until the user guesses the correct number

#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <ctime>
using namespace std;

class Random {
private:
    int randomNumber; // Random number between 1 and 100
    int guess;        // User's guess
    int attempts;     // Track the number of attempts

public:
    // Constructor to initialize values
    Random() {
        std::srand(std::time(0));
        randomNumber = std::rand() % 100 + 1;
        guess = 0;
        attempts = 0;
    }

    // Function to play the game
    void play() {
        cout << "--------LET'S PLAY A NUMBER GUESSING GAME---------\n";
        cout << "I have created a number between 1 and 100.\n";
        cout << "You have to guess it correctly!\n";

        while (true) {
            cout << "\nEnter Your Guess: ";
            cin >> guess;
            attempts++;  // Increment attempt count

            if (guess > randomNumber) {
                cout << "Too high!!!\n";
                motivate();
            } 
            else if (guess < randomNumber) {
                cout << "Too low!!!\n";
                motivate();
            } 
            else {
                cout << "\nCONGRATULATIONS! You guessed it correctly in " << attempts << " attempts!\n";
                break;
            }
        }

        // Show message based on attempts
        finalMessage();
    }

    // Function to give motivational feedback
    void motivate() {
        if (attempts <= 3) {
            cout << "You're getting close! Keep going!\n";
        } else if (attempts > 3 && attempts <= 6) {
            cout << "You're doing well! Don't give up!\n";
        } else {
            cout << "It's a tricky one, but you can do it!\n";
        }
    }

    // Final message based on number of attempts
    void finalMessage() {
        if (attempts <= 3) {
            cout << "Amazing! You have a sharp mind!\n";
        } else if (attempts <= 6) {
            cout << "Great job! You did it in a decent number of attempts!\n";
        } else {
            cout << "Good effort! It took you a few tries, but persistence wins!\n";
        }
    }
};

int main() {
    Random number;
    number.play();
    return 0;
